## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Photo Mapping Function
```typescript
const getProfilePhotoUrl = (name: string): string => {
  const photoMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    "Bhushan Barun Mallick": "/assets/images/team/Bhushan.jpg",
    "Devesh Rahangdale": "/assets/images/team/devesh.jpg", 
    "Pranav Anand Deshpande": "/assets/images/team/pranav.jpg",
    "Samiksha Wasnik": "/assets/images/team/samiksha.jpg",
    "Sneha Deherarkar": "/assets/images/team/sneha.jpg",
    "Ujwal Vilas Didhate": "/assets/images/team/ujwal.jpg",
    "Kanchan Rawat": "/assets/images/team/kanchan.jpg",
  };
  
  const photoUrl = photoMap[name];
  
  if (photoUrl) {
    console.log(`📸 Photo found for "${name}" → ${photoUrl}`);
    return photoUrl;
  } else {
    console.warn(`⚠️ No photo mapping found for: "${name}"`);
    console.log("Available mappings:", Object.keys(photoMap));
    
    // SVG fallback with colored initials
    const initials = name.split(' ').map(n => n.charAt(0)).join('').toUpperCase();
    const colors = ['#3B82F6', '#10B981', '#F59E0B', '#EF4444', '#8B5CF6', '#06B6D4', '#84CC16'];
    const colorIndex = name.length % colors.length;
    const bgColor = colors[colorIndex];
    
    return `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${btoa(`
      <svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="100" fill="${bgColor}"/>
        <text x="100" y="120" text-anchor="middle" fill="white" font-size="60" font-family="Arial, sans-serif" font-weight="bold">
          ${initials}
        </text>
      </svg>
    `)}`;
  }
};
```

### 2. Forced Local Photo Usage
- **Admin Photo**: Uses `getProfilePhotoUrl("Bhushan Barun Mallick")`
- **Member Photos**: Firebase data is overridden with local photos using `getProfilePhotoUrl()`
- **Fallback System**: SVG initials with colored backgrounds for missing photos

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
- ✅ Photo mapping logs for each member
- ✅ Success logs when photos load
- ❌ Error logs when photos fail to load
- 📋 Available mappings list for debugging

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Open Team Showcase Page
Navigate to the team showcase page in your browser.

### 2. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these console messages:

#### Expected Success Messages:
```
📸 Photo found for "Bhushan Barun Mallick" → /assets/images/team/Bhushan.jpg
✅ Admin photo loaded successfully: Bhushan Barun Mallick - /assets/images/team/Bhushan.jpg
📸 Photo found for "Devesh Rahangdale" → /assets/images/team/devesh.jpg
✅ Photo loaded successfully: Devesh Rahangdale - /assets/images/team/devesh.jpg
... (and so on for all members)
```

#### If Photos Fail:
```
❌ Photo failed to load: [Name] - [URL]
⚠️ No photo mapping found for: "[Name]"
Available mappings: [list of available names]
```

### 3. Visual Verification
- **Admin Section**: Should show Bhushan's photo (large, circular)
- **Members Section**: Should show all 6 member photos (smaller, circular)
- **Fallback**: If any photo fails, should show colored initials

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Photos Still Don't Display:

#### 1. Check Console Logs
- Are photo mapping logs appearing?
- Are there any error messages?
- Do the URLs look correct?

#### 2. Network Tab (F12 → Network)
- Are photo requests being made?
- Are any returning 404 errors?
- Check the actual URLs being requested

#### 3. Verify Photo Files
Run the verification script:
```bash
node verify-photos.js
```

#### 4. Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely

#### 5. Check File Permissions
Ensure the photo files are readable and the web server can access them.

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Admin Photo (Bhushan):
- ✅ Large circular photo in the leader section
- ✅ Uses `/assets/images/team/Bhushan.jpg`
- ✅ Animated entrance effect
- ✅ Hover scale effect

### Member Photos:
- ✅ Smaller circular photos in member cards
- ✅ Each uses their respective photo from `/assets/images/team/`
- ✅ Status indicator (green dot for active)
- ✅ Hover effects on cards

### Fallback System:
- ✅ If photo fails to load, shows colored SVG with initials
- ✅ Different colors for different members
- ✅ Graceful degradation, no broken images

## 📝 Photo Verification Script

Use `verify-photos.js` to check all photos:

```bash
cd infi-x-tech-website
node verify-photos.js
```

This will show:
- ✅ Which photos exist and their file sizes
- ❌ Which photos are missing
- 📋 Name-to-photo mapping verification

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the page** - Open team showcase and check console
2. **Report specific issues** - If any photos still don't show, note which ones
3. **Check console logs** - Look for the debug messages
4. **Verify all 7 members** - Admin + 6 team members should all display

## 📞 Support

If photos still don't display after following this guide:

1. **Share console logs** - Copy any error messages
2. **Share network tab** - Show any 404 or failed requests  
3. **Share screenshot** - Show what you see vs what's expected
4. **Run verification script** - Share the output of `node verify-photos.js`

The enhanced logging will help identify exactly what's happening with each photo! 🔍
