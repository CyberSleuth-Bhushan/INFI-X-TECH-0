# Team Photos Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Team members were displaying Google account photos instead of local team photos from the specified directory.

**Root Cause**: The Firebase data processing was using `data.profilePhotoUrl || getProfilePhotoUrl(...)` which meant if Firebase contained a `profilePhotoUrl` (Google account photo), it would use that instead of our local team photos.

## Solution Applied

### Code Change Made:
**File**: `src/pages/public/TeamShowcase.tsx`

**Before** (Line 120-122):
```typescript
profilePhotoUrl:
  data.profilePhotoUrl ||
  getProfilePhotoUrl(data.personalDetails?.name || ""),
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Always use our local team photos, ignore Firebase profilePhotoUrl
profilePhotoUrl: getProfilePhotoUrl(data.personalDetails?.name || ""),
```

### What This Fix Does:
1. **Forces Local Photos**: Always uses local team photos regardless of what's stored in Firebase
2. **Ignores Google Photos**: Completely ignores any `profilePhotoUrl` from Firebase user data
3. **Consistent Mapping**: Uses the `getProfilePhotoUrl()` function to map names to correct local photos

## Team Photo Mapping (Confirmed Working)

The `getProfilePhotoUrl()` function correctly maps team member names to their local photos:

```typescript
const photoMap = {
  "Bhushan Barun Mallick": "/assets/images/team/Bhushan.jpg",     ✅
  "Devesh Rahangdale": "/assets/images/team/devesh.jpg",          ✅
  "Pranav Anand Deshpande": "/assets/images/team/pranav.jpg",     ✅
  "Samiksha Wasnik": "/assets/images/team/samiksha.jpg",          ✅
  "Sneha Deherarkar": "/assets/images/team/sneha.jpg",            ✅
  "Ujwal Vilas Didhate": "/assets/images/team/ujwal.jpg",         ✅
  "Kanchan Rawat": "/assets/images/team/kanchan.jpg",             ✅
};
```

## Directory Structure Confirmed

Photos are correctly located at:
```
C:\Users\bhush\Desktop\INFI X TECH new\infi-x-tech-website\public\assets\images\team\
├── Bhushan.jpg     ✅
├── devesh.jpg      ✅
├── kanchan.jpg     ✅
├── pranav.jpg      ✅
├── samiksha.jpg    ✅
├── sneha.jpg       ✅
└── ujwal.jpg       ✅
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Firebase Query**: Fetches team member data from Firebase
2. **Photo Override**: Ignores any `profilePhotoUrl` from Firebase
3. **Local Mapping**: Uses `getProfilePhotoUrl()` to map names to local photos
4. **Fallback System**: If Firebase fails, uses predefined data with same photo mapping
5. **Error Handling**: If local photo fails to load, shows initials as fallback

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Status**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **Photo Paths**: All mapped correctly to local directory
- ✅ **Firebase Override**: Google account photos are now ignored
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Works with local photos in all scenarios
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to initials if photo fails

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**: 
- Team members showed Google account profile pictures
- Local team photos were ignored if Firebase had profilePhotoUrl

**After Fix**:
- Team members will ALWAYS show local team photos from `/assets/images/team/`
- Google account photos are completely ignored
- Consistent photo display regardless of Firebase data

## Technical Details

### Priority Order (Fixed):
1. **Local Team Photos** (Always used) ✅
2. **Fallback to Initials** (If photo fails to load) ✅
3. ~~Firebase profilePhotoUrl~~ (Now ignored) ❌

### Data Flow:
```
Firebase Data → Name Extraction → getProfilePhotoUrl() → Local Photo Path
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:
1. Check team showcase page
2. All team members should show local photos from the team directory
3. No Google account photos should be visible
4. Photos should load from `/assets/images/team/` directory

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The team members will now display their local team photos from the specified directory instead of Google account photos. The fix ensures consistent photo display regardless of what's stored in Firebase.
