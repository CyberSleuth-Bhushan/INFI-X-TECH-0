    member.isActive ? 'bg-green-400' : 'bg-gray-400'
  } rounded-full border-2 border-white shadow-lg`}
  animate={member.isActive ? { scale: [1, 1.1, 1] } : {}}
  transition={{ duration: 2, repeat: Infinity }}
  title={member.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
/>
```

### Social Links Enhancement
```typescript
// Dynamic social links rendering
{member.socialLinks && Object.keys(member.socialLinks).some(key => member.socialLinks![key]) && (
  <div className="flex justify-center space-x-3 mb-4">
    {/* Render only non-empty social links */}
  </div>
)}
```
