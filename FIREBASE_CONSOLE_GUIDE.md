## Alternative Method - Using Firebase CLI:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Set your project
firebase use infi-x-tech-website-1

# Use Firestore emulator or direct database access
```

## Verification:

After making changes:
1. **Go to your website**
2. **Login with**: `bhushanmallick2006@gmail.com` / `Bhushan@Admin`
3. **You should be redirected to**: `/admin-dashboard`
4. **You should see admin features** like user management, event creation, etc.
